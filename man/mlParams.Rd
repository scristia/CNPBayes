\title{Parameters for evaluating marginal likelihood}
\usage{
mlParams(
  root = 1/10,
  reject.threshold = exp(-10),
  prop.threshold = 0.5,
  prop.effective.size = 0.05,
  ignore.effective.size = FALSE,
  ignore.small.pstar = FALSE,
  warnings = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{root}{length-one numeric vector. We exponentiate \code{p(theta* | ...)}
by the value of \code{root}. Values less than one reduce the influence of
extreme observations.}

\item{reject.threshold}{length-one numeric vector between 0 and 1.
Probabilities in the reduced Gibbs model for the thetas that are less than
this threshold are flagged.}

\item{prop.threshold}{length-one numeric vector between 0 and 1. If more than
\code{prop.threshold} are flagged, the marginal likelihood is not
evaluated.}

\item{prop.effective.size}{Logical. If the effective size / total iterations
is less than \code{prop.effective.size}, the marginal likelihood is not
evaluated (unless \code{ignore.effective.size} is \code{TRUE}).}

\item{ignore.effective.size}{Logical. By default, if the effective size of
any theta chain is less than 0.02, the marginal likelihood is not
calculated. If this parameter is set to TRUE, the effective size is
ignored. Occasionally, the effective size is misleading. See details.}

\item{ignore.small.pstar}{Logical. Flags from the \code{reject.threshold}
parameter are ignored and the marginal likelihood is calculated.}

\item{warnings}{Logical. If FALSE, warnings are not issued. This is FALSE by
default for the marginalLikelihood-list method, and TRUE otherwise.}
}
\value{
a list of parameters to be passed to \code{marginalLikelihood}.

\description{
Parameters for evaluating marginal likelihood
}
\details{
For mixture models, a low effective size of one or more theta chains can
 occur for the following reasons:

A. the model has not yet converged

B. the model is overfit and there is lots of mixing (label swapping )between
  some of the chains

C. the model is not overfit but there is a lot of mixing of the thetas

For both (A) and (B) it is desirable to return NAs. While (C) can also occur,
it can be easily diagnosed by visual inspection of the chains. To the extent
that (C) occurs, the correction factor may not be needed.
