  abstract    = {Accurate assignment of copy number at known copy number variant (CNV) loci is important for both increasing understanding of the structural evolution of genomes as well as for carrying out association studies of copy number with disease. As with calling SNP genotypes, the task can be framed as a clustering problem but for a number of reasons assigning copy number is much more challenging. CNV assays have lower signal-to-noise ratios than SNP assays, often display heavy tailed and asymmetric intensity distributions, contain outlying observations and may exhibit systematic technical differences among different cohorts. In addition, the number of copy-number classes at a CNV in the population may be unknown a priori. Due to these complications, automatic and robust assignment of copy number from array data remains a challenging problem. We have developed a copy number assignment algorithm, CNVCALL, for a targeted CNV array, such as that used by the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium's recent CNV association study. We use a Bayesian hierarchical mixture model that robustly identifies both the number of different copy number classes at a specific locus as well as relative copy number for each individual in the sample. This approach is fully automated which is a critical requirement when analyzing large numbers of CNVs. We illustrate the methods performance using real data from the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium's CNV association study and using simulated data.},

  abstract    = {Accurate and complete measurement of single nucleotide (SNP) and copy number (CNV) variants, both common and rare, will be required to understand the role of genetic variation in disease. We present Birdsuite, a four-stage analytical framework instantiated in software for deriving integrated and mutually consistent copy number and SNP genotypes. The method sequentially assigns copy number across regions of common copy number polymorphisms (CNPs), calls genotypes of SNPs, identifies rare CNVs via a hidden Markov model (HMM), and generates an integrated sequence and copy number genotype at every locus (for example, including genotypes such as A-null, AAB and BBB in addition to AA, AB and BB calls). Such genotypes more accurately depict the underlying sequence of each individual, reducing the rate of apparent mendelian inconsistencies. The Birdsuite software is applied here to data from the Affymetrix SNP 6.0 array. Additionally, we describe a method, implemented in PLINK, to utilize these combined SNP and CNV genotypes for association testing with a phenotype.},

  abstract    = {Sequencing of gene-coding regions (the
 exome) is increasingly used for studying human
 disease, for which copy-number variants (CNVs) are a
 critical genetic component. However, detecting copy
 number from exome sequencing is challenging because
 of the noncontiguous nature of the captured
 exons. This is compounded by the complex
 relationship between read depth and copy number;
 this results from biases in targeted genomic
 hybridization, sequence factors such as GC content,
 and batching of samples during collection and
 sequencing. We present a statistical tool (exome
 hidden Markov model [XHMM]) that uses
 principal-component analysis (PCA) to normalize
 exome read depth and a hidden Markov model (HMM) to
 discover exon-resolution CNV and genotype variation
 across samples. We evaluate performance on 90
 schizophrenia trios and 1,017 case-control
 samples. XHMM detects a median of two rare (<1\%)
 CNVs per individual (one deletion and one
 duplication) and has 79\% sensitivity to similarly
 rare CNVs overlapping three or more exons discovered
 with microarrays. With sensitivity similar to
 state-of-the-art methods, XHMM achieves higher
 specificity by assigning quality metrics to the CNV
 calls to filter out bad ones, as well as to
 statistically genotype the discovered CNV in all
 individuals, yielding a trio call set with
 Mendelian-inheritance properties highly consistent
 with expectation. We also show that XHMM breakpoint
 quality scores enable researchers to explicitly
 search for novel classes of structural
 variation. For example, we apply XHMM to extract
 those CNVs that are highlyÂ likely to disrupt (delete
 or duplicate) only a portion of a gene.},

The functional impact of CNV cannot be fully captured through linkage disequilibrium with SNPs. These observations motivate the development of statistical methods for performing direct CNV association studies. We show through simulation that current tests for CNV association are prone to false-positive associations in the presence of differential errors between cases and controls, especially if quantitative CNV measurements are noisy. We present a statistical framework for performing case-control CNV association studies that applies likelihood ratio testing of quantitative CNV measurements in cases and controls. We show that our methods

are robust to differential errors and noisy data and can achieve maximal theoretical power. We illustrate the power of these methods for testing for association with binary and quantitative traits, and have made this software available as the R package CNVtools.},

One often overlooked complication with such studies is batch effects, which occur because measurements are affected by laboratory conditions, reagent lots and personnel differences. This becomes a major problem when batch effects are correlated with an outcome of interest and lead to incorrect conclusions. Using both published studies and our own analyses, we argue that batch effects (as well as other technical and biological artefacts) are widespread and critical to address. We review experimental and computational approaches for doing so.},
